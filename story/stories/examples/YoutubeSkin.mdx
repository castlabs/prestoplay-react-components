# Example: Youtube look-alike

PRESTOplay React can be used to build all kinds of UIs. Let's have a look at this example which tries to recreate the all too familiar look of the Youtube player by combining some components from PRESTOplay React and overriding a couple of styles.

<Canvas of={YoutubeSkin.Primary} sourceState="none" />

The Default Skin is highly customizable. Refer to the
<Link title="Components Base Theme Overlay">BaseThemeOverlay docs</Link> for details and for more information
about the root component, visit the <Link title="Components Player Surface">PlayerSurface docs</Link>.

## Source Code

Start by instantiating the `Player`, make sure you always use <Link title="Components Player Surface">PlayerSurface</Link> as your root component, then render your UI inside.

<Source code={SOURCE_YOUTUBE_SKIN} />

## CSS Styles

Override CSS styles with `youtube-style.css`. In this example we override several existing style rules and add a couple of new ones.

PRESTOplay React class selectors follow the `pp-ui-*` format.

<Source code={SOURCE_YOUTUBE_CSS} />
