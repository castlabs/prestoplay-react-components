# Player Surface

Player Surface is a root component that should always be rendered first and it should contain all PRESTOplay UI components.


Is serves two purposes: It renders a video element which stretches across its whole area and it serves as a container
for player UI controls. **It supplies its sub-components with the necessary React context and gives them access
PRESTOplay player instance**, so that they can either control it (e.g. the `PlayPauseButton` can call play or pause)
or react to state changes (e.g. `SeekBar` renders the current timeline position).

Player surface also serves as the element which will enter full-screen mode when it is requested. (With the exception
or certain platforms that do not support full-screen mode for `<div>` elements).
