# Future steps

## TODO
1. Create a code example.
2. TODO publish beta.
3. TODO fix the rest of the UI.

## Comm
1. Media tailor - Timing of ad

## Future
1. For VOD make sure seeking into ad break interval makes the ad appear. Now seeking after also triggers it, we do not want that.
2. Full screen.
3. Finnish Innovid integration.
   1. Actions pause /resume /stop and resume. First get example ad on which to test it.
   2. Actions expend /collapse. First get example ad on which to test it.
4. Add ad tracking (pings). First get a good API doc from MediaTailor on where tracking events are located in the response and what `eventType`s to expect.
5. Make it a plugin / component.
6. See `FUTURE`, `TODOIN`.
