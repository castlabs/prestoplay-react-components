import { MediaTailorPlayer } from '@castlabs/prestoplay-react-components'
import poster from '../assets/poster.png' // Create this asset first

import "@castlabs/prestoplay/clpp.styles.css"
import "@castlabs/prestoplay-react-components/dist/themes/pp-ui-base-theme-embedded.css"

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <MediaTailorPlayer
      poster={poster}
      prestoConfig={{ license: "..." }} // Generated by someone at castLabs
      mediaTailorConfig={{ sessionUri: "..." }} // MediaTailor session URI
      autoplay
    />
  )
}
```
