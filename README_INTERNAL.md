# PRESTOplay React Components

The library is written in TypeScript and comes with a small react application that we use for development.

## Get started

```sh
npm i
```

## Develop

To start the dev app and watch for any file changes, run:
```sh
npm run start
```

## Build

To compile the library run:
```sh
npm run build
```

## Publish

TODO auto via pipeline. Just create a release > create a new tag >
this will trigger auto publish to NPM and docs.

## Test

```sh
npm run test
```

## Docs

We are transitioning to use `Storybook` for public docs. Once that is done `app` can be deleted.

```sh
npm run storybook
```

## Publishing
